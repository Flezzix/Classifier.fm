# Classifier.fm
A music genre classifier built with Python, librosa, and machine learning. Upload a song clip and let the model analyze its audio features to predict the genre.

To run the app:
Download resnet_genre.pth from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndigq87WDMbCDy6ldSP3zTP9Dr3DyUdq/view?usp=drive_link and place it in classifier.fm/model/.

or

Train the model yourself using train.py and the GTZAN dataset, which you would place in classifier.fm/data/(all genres from dataset).

Trained on GTZAN dataset using ResNet18.
